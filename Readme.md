# Blätter Export Epub

This module lets you select an issue from the "Blätter für deutsche und internationale Politik" and exports it as an epub or mobi.

This module will only work within the Drupal installation of the Blätter, there is no further work planned to abstract or generalize this.

You are, however, free to fork or use this module for your own purposes.

## Hints

- The export will include some webfonts into the ePub. As of copyrights theese fonts are not part of this repository. The fonts need to be installed afterinstalling the module.
- There are some domain and path references in the code that are pinned to specific domains and paths of the Drupal installation of the Blätter.
